Terinal images 2
----------------

Experimental rework of
[vim-terminal-images](https://github.com/sergei-grechanik/vim-terminal-images) by Sergei Grechanik.
The differences include:
- A simpler one-column positioning algorithm
- More aggressive preservation of vim resources (properties, popup windows)
- Quiet image uploading to work around problems caused by the `tupimage` statusline
- No CursorHold handler and fewer Vim commands are installed
