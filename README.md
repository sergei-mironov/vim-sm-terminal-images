Terinal images 2
----------------

Rework of [vim-terminal-images](https://github.com/sergei-grechanik/vim-terminal-images),
entirely experimental.

The intended differences are:
- Less aggressive image positioning
- Fast image "reloading" via the restoration of text properties on buffer rereads (handling of
  Litrepl evaluations)
